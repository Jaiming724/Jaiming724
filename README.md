# Hi thereðŸ‘‹
## I'm Jiaming, a Penn State student majoring in electrical engineering and computer science. Here's a short summary of what I do!
* I worked as a Battery Management Intern at Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WABTEC) this summer, where I applied my electrical and software knowledge to enhance the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HITL) system used by the battery team. This work was crucial in simulating and improving the performance of the upcoming FLXDrive Electric Train.
* I am the Software Lead for Penn State's Wind Energy Team, where we design and build a wind turbine from the ground up to compete in the Department of Energy's Collegiate Wind Competition. Our team placed 2nd in 2022, 4th in 2023, and we are striving for 1st in 2024.
* I also part of the [CTFGuide](https://ctfguide.com/), where we are innovating the futher of cybersecurity.
